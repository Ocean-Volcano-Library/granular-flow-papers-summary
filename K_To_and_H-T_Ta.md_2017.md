## Overview
1. Conduct 2-d silo flow with linear oscillating exit
2. Results
    - Large exit (D>5d): 
        1. flow rate W is linearly decreasing with exit max. acceleration, Γ : Unknown physical mechanism for flow reduction
        2. flow rate collapse on a line when plotting with new variable ξ=W_o (D-k)^(3/2)-c(D-5)Γ 
    - Small exit (D<5d): 
        1. flow rate is monotonically increasing with exit max. velocity v
        2. The smallest exit (1.27d) starts to decrease when v≥0.28
    - Intermittent flow regime: 
       1. t_flow : probability density ~ exponential
       2. t_recovery: probability density ~ power-law
       3. Duty cycle Φ≡t_flow/T: increases with diameter
